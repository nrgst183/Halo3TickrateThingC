# Halo 3 Tickrate Thing

Changes the Halo 3 MCC tickrate from 60 to 30 to fix issues/weirdness (but made in C with Win32 API). 

Instructions:

Start MCC with anticheat off. 
Start the tick rate tool and flip the checkbox. 

The tool should auto apply the right tickrate/time per tick, and you can leave it minimized after that.
